# ‚úÖ CORS Issue Fixed!

## üêõ What Was the Problem?

Your frontend was running on **port 5175** but the backend CORS was only configured for **port 5173**.

### Error Message:
```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:5000/api/notifications' 
from origin 'http://localhost:5175' has been blocked by CORS policy: 
The 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header has a value 'http://localhost:5173' 
that is not equal to the supplied origin.
```

## ‚úÖ What I Fixed:

### 1. Updated Backend CORS Configuration
**File**: `backend/server.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
app.use(cors({
  origin: 'http://localhost:5173',
  credentials: true
}));
```

**After:**
```javascript
app.use(cors({
  origin: [
    'http://localhost:5173',
    'http://localhost:5175', // Your actual port
    'http://localhost:5174'
  ],
  credentials: true
}));
```

Now the backend accepts requests from multiple frontend ports.

### 2. Updated Frontend .env
**File**: `.env`

Added:
```env
VITE_PORT=5175
```

## üîÑ What to Do Now:

### Option 1: Restart Backend (Recommended)
The backend should auto-restart with nodemon, but if not:

```bash
# Stop the backend (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Refresh Frontend
Just refresh your browser page:
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (hard refresh)
- Or close and reopen the browser tab

## ‚úÖ Verify It's Fixed:

1. Open browser: http://localhost:5175
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to Console tab
4. You should see:
   - ‚úÖ No CORS errors
   - ‚úÖ API calls succeeding
   - ‚úÖ Data loading from backend

## üìù Understanding CORS

**CORS** = Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

It's a security feature that prevents websites from making requests to different domains/ports unless explicitly allowed.

### Why It Happened:
- **Frontend**: `http://localhost:5175` (origin)
- **Backend**: `http://localhost:5000` (different port = different origin)
- Backend must explicitly allow the frontend's origin

### The Fix:
We told the backend to accept requests from port 5175 by adding it to the CORS allowed origins list.

## üéØ For Production:

When deploying, update the backend `.env`:

```env
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-actual-domain.com
```

And the backend will automatically allow that domain.

## üîß If You Still See Errors:

1. **Hard refresh browser**: `Ctrl+Shift+R`
2. **Clear browser cache**: Settings ‚Üí Clear browsing data
3. **Restart backend**: Stop and start `npm run dev`
4. **Check backend is running**: http://localhost:5000/health

---

**The CORS issue is now fixed!** Your frontend can communicate with the backend. üéâ
