# ✅ React Object Rendering Error Fixed

## 🐛 The Error

```
Uncaught Error: Objects are not valid as a React child 
(found: object with keys {id, firstName, lastName}). 
If you meant to render a collection of children, use an array instead.
```

## 🔍 What Caused It

In the Assignments page, the code was trying to render a teacher object directly:

```jsx
// ❌ Wrong - Can't render object directly
<span>{assignment.teacher}</span>
```

When `assignment.teacher` is an object like:
```javascript
{
  id: 1,
  firstName: "Michael",
  lastName: "Davis"
}
```

React cannot render this object directly in JSX.

## ✅ The Fix

Changed to properly extract and display the teacher's name:

```jsx
// ✅ Correct - Render string values
<span>
  {assignment.teacher 
    ? `${assignment.teacher.firstName} ${assignment.teacher.lastName}`
    : 'Teacher'}
</span>
```

## 📝 What This Does

1. **Checks if teacher exists**: `assignment.teacher ?`
2. **Extracts name properties**: `firstName` and `lastName`
3. **Combines into string**: Template literal creates "Michael Davis"
4. **Fallback**: Shows 'Teacher' if no teacher data
5. **Renders as text**: React can display strings

## 🔧 Where It Was Fixed

**File**: `src/pages/student/Assignments.jsx`

**Two locations:**
1. **Line 194-198**: Pending assignments tab
2. **Line 262-266**: Submitted assignments tab

Both now properly display teacher names.

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Before (Error):
```jsx
<span>{assignment.teacher}</span>
// Tries to render: {id: 1, firstName: "Michael", lastName: "Davis"}
// ❌ Error: Can't render object
```

### After (Fixed):
```jsx
<span>
  {assignment.teacher 
    ? `${assignment.teacher.firstName} ${assignment.teacher.lastName}`
    : 'Teacher'}
</span>
// Renders: "Michael Davis"
// ✅ Works: Renders string
```

## 📊 What Students See Now

In the Assignments page, they'll see:
- ✅ Teacher name: "Michael Davis" (or other teacher names)
- ✅ Assignment details
- ✅ Due dates
- ✅ Submit buttons

## 🧪 Test It

1. **Refresh browser**: `Ctrl+Shift+R`
2. **Login as student**
3. **Go to Assignments tab**
4. **You should see**:
   - No errors in console
   - Teacher names displayed correctly
   - Assignment cards render properly

## 💡 Key Learning

**React Rendering Rules:**
- ✅ Can render: Strings, numbers, arrays
- ❌ Cannot render: Objects, functions
- ✅ Solution: Extract values from objects first

**Common Pattern:**
```jsx
// Object from API
const user = { id: 1, firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe" }

// ❌ Wrong
<div>{user}</div>

// ✅ Correct
<div>{user.firstName} {user.lastName}</div>
<div>{`${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`}</div>
```

## 🔄 Similar Fixes Applied

This same pattern is used throughout the app for:
- Teacher names in assignments
- Student names in submissions
- User names in dashboards
- Instructor names in courses

All now properly extract and display name strings.
