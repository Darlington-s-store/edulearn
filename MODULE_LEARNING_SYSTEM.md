### 10. **Technical Implementation**

#### State Management
- `currentLessonIndex`: Track current lesson
- `completedLessons`: Array of completed lesson IDs
- `videoProgress`: Video watch percentage
- `contentRead`: Content reading status
- `pdfViewed`: PDF download status
- `quizAnswers`: User's quiz responses
- `quizSubmitted`: Quiz submission state
- `quizScore`: Quiz result percentage

#### Validation Logic
```javascript
// Can access lesson?
canAccessLesson = currentLessonIndex === 0 || 
                  completedLessons.includes(previousLesson.id)

// Can take quiz?
canTakeQuiz = (videoProgress >= 80 || contentRead) && 
              (!hasPDF || pdfViewed)

// Lesson completed?
isCompleted = completedLessons.includes(lesson.id)
```
