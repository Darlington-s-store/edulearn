# 🔧 Login Issues - Troubleshooting & Fix

## 🐛 "Misbehaving After Login" - What Could It Be?

### Common Issues After Login:

1. **Pages loading forever** → API calls failing
2. **Blank/white screen** → JavaScript error
3. **Redirects not working** → Route issue
4. **Data not showing** → Backend not running
5. **Console errors** → Check browser console

## ✅ What I Just Fixed

Added better error handling in `ContentContextAPI`:
- Safe access with optional chaining (`?.`)
- Fallback to empty arrays on error
- Won't crash if backend is down

## 🔍 How to Diagnose

### Step 1: Check Browser Console

1. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Look for **red errors**
4. Tell me what errors you see

### Step 2: Check Network Tab

1. Press `F12`
2. Go to **Network** tab
3. Login again
4. Look for failed requests (red)
5. Check which API calls are failing

### Step 3: Check Backend

Is the backend running?
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

Should see:
```
✅ Database connection established
🚀 Server running on port 5000
```

## 🎯 Common "Misbehaving" Symptoms & Fixes

### Symptom 1: Infinite Loading

**Cause**: API calls not completing
**Fix**: 
- Check backend is running
- Check console for errors
- Check Network tab for failed requests

### Symptom 2: Blank Screen

**Cause**: JavaScript error breaking the app
**Fix**:
- Check console for errors
- Look for "Uncaught Error" messages
- Share the error with me

### Symptom 3: Wrong Dashboard

**Cause**: Role-based routing issue
**Fix**:
- Check you're logging in with correct role
- Student → student@example.com
- Teacher → teacher@example.com

### Symptom 4: Data Not Showing

**Cause**: Backend not returning data
**Fix**:
- Check backend is running
- Check database has data: `node check-modules.js`
- Run seed if needed: `npm run seed`

### Symptom 5: Logout Immediately

**Cause**: Token/auth issue
**Fix**:
- Clear browser cache
- Clear localStorage (F12 → Application → Clear Storage)
- Login again

### Symptom 6: Multiple API Calls

**Cause**: useEffect running multiple times
**Fix**: Already handled with proper dependencies

## 🧪 Quick Test

### Test Login Flow:

1. **Clear everything first**:
   ```
   F12 → Console → Clear
   F12 → Application → Clear Storage → Clear site data
   ```

2. **Refresh page**: `Ctrl+Shift+R`

3. **Login as student**:
   - Email: `student@example.com`
   - Password: `password123`
   - Role: Student

4. **Check what happens**:
   - Does it redirect to dashboard?
   - Do you see the sidebar?
   - Are there errors in console?
   - Does data load?
