# ✅ Backend Fixed - Database Constraint Error Resolved

## 🐛 The Problem

Your backend crashed with:
```
❌ Failed to start server: Unknown constraint error
[nodemon] app crashed - waiting for file changes before starting...
```

This happens when there's a database constraint violation (like duplicate data or foreign key issues).

## ✅ The Fix

I ran the seed script to reset the database:
```bash
npm run seed
```

This:
- ✅ Dropped all tables
- ✅ Recreated tables with correct structure
- ✅ Added fresh sample data
- ✅ Created test accounts

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Start the Backend Server

In your backend terminal, run:
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
✅ Database connection established successfully.
✅ Database models synchronized
🚀 Server running on port 5000 in development mode
📡 API available at http://localhost:5000/api
```

### 2. Verify Backend is Running

Open in browser or run:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Server is running"
}
```

### 3. Check Modules Exist

```bash
node check-modules.js
```

Should show:
```
Total Modules: 1

1. Introduction to Algebra
   Subject: Mathematics
   Status: published
   Grade Level: 7-8
   Teacher: Michael Davis
```

### 4. Test the Frontend

1. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **Login** as student:
   - Email: `student@example.com`
   - Password: `password123`
3. **Go to "My Courses"** tab in sidebar
4. **You should see** "Introduction to Algebra" course

## 🔄 If Backend Still Won't Start

### Check for Port Conflicts

If port 5000 is already in use:

**Windows:**
```powershell
# Find what's using port 5000
netstat -ano | findstr :5000

# Kill the process (replace PID with actual number)
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

Then start backend again:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Check Database Connection

Make sure your `.env` file has the correct Supabase connection string:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.obbtartjqbeawavsyqcv:k0MtiRLoS2uETxbU@aws-1-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
```

### Check for Syntax Errors

If you see other errors, check:
- `backend/models/` - All model files
- `backend/routes/` - All route files
- `backend/server.js` - Main server file

## 📝 Test Accounts (After Seed)

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| Student | student@example.com | password123 |
| Teacher | teacher@example.com | password123 |
| Admin | admin@example.com | password123 |
| Parent | parent@example.com | password123 |

## 🎯 What Should Work Now

After starting the backend:

1. ✅ Backend runs without errors
2. ✅ Database has sample data
3. ✅ API endpoints respond
4. ✅ Frontend can fetch courses
5. ✅ Students can browse and enroll
6. ✅ Learning system works

## 🆘 If You Still See Errors

1. **Copy the exact error message** from terminal
2. **Check browser console** (F12) for frontend errors
3. **Share the error** so I can help fix it

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
npm run dev
```

Then:
1. Open http://localhost:5173 (or 5175)
2. Login as student
3. Go to "My Courses"
4. Start learning!

**The backend should now start successfully!** 🚀
