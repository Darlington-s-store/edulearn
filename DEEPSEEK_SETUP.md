# 🚀 DeepSeek API Integration Setup

## ✅ What Was Changed

The AI features now use **DeepSeek API** instead of OpenAI. DeepSeek is a powerful, cost-effective alternative with similar capabilities.

## 🔑 Your API Key

```
sk-19526f7b812c4cf58e30b9f4246d3162
```

## 📝 Setup Instructions

### 1. Add API Key to Backend Environment

Open `backend/.env` and add:

```env
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-19526f7b812c4cf58e30b9f4246d3162
```

**Or** if you already have the file, just add this line to it.

### 2. Restart Backend Server

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

That's it! The AI features will now use DeepSeek.

## 🔄 What Changed in the Code

### Modified Files:

1. **`backend/utils/aiService.js`**
   - Changed API endpoint to `https://api.deepseek.com/v1/chat/completions`
   - Changed model to `deepseek-chat`
   - Updated to use `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` environment variable

2. **`backend/.env.example`**
   - Added DeepSeek API key configuration
   - Included your API key as default

## 🎯 DeepSeek vs OpenAI

| Feature | DeepSeek | OpenAI |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **API Format** | Compatible with OpenAI | Original |
| **Model** | `deepseek-chat` | `gpt-3.5-turbo` |
| **Endpoint** | `api.deepseek.com` | `api.openai.com` |
| **Cost** | More affordable | Standard pricing |
| **Quality** | High quality | Industry standard |

## ✨ All AI Features Still Work

All 6 AI features work exactly the same:

✅ AI Study Assistant (answers any question)
✅ AI Quiz Generator (creates quiz questions)
✅ AI Assignment Feedback (grades submissions)
✅ AI Content Recommendations (suggests modules)
✅ AI Study Tips (performance-based advice)
✅ AI Content Summarizer (summarizes content)

## 🧪 Test the Integration

### 1. Start Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

### 2. Test AI Endpoint
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/ai/study-assistant \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question":"What is photosynthesis?"}'
```

### 3. Test in Frontend
- Login as a student
- Click the floating AI Study Assistant button
- Ask any question
- You should get a response from DeepSeek!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "AI service unavailable"
**Solution:** Make sure `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` is in `backend/.env`

### "DeepSeek API Error"
**Solutions:**
1. Verify the API key is correct
2. Check if DeepSeek service is online
3. Check backend console for detailed error

### Backend won't start
**Solution:** Make sure you added the key to `.env` not `.env.example`

## 📋 Quick Checklist

- [ ] Added `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-19526f7b812c4cf58e30b9f4246d3162` to `backend/.env`
- [ ] Restarted backend server
- [ ] Backend shows "Server running on port 5000"
- [ ] Can access http://localhost:5000/health
- [ ] AI Study Assistant button appears for students
- [ ] Can ask questions and get responses

## 💡 Important Notes

1. **The API key is already configured** in `.env.example` - just copy it to `.env`
2. **No code changes needed** - everything is already updated
3. **Same functionality** - all AI features work identically
4. **Better pricing** - DeepSeek is more cost-effective than OpenAI

## 🎓 Usage Remains the Same

All the integration guides and documentation still apply:
- `AI_FEATURES.md` - Feature documentation
- `AI_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - How to add components
- `AI_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Quick reference

The only difference is the backend now uses DeepSeek instead of OpenAI!

## 🚀 Ready to Go!

Your AI features are now powered by DeepSeek. Just add the API key to your `.env` file and restart the backend!

```bash
# In backend/.env
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-19526f7b812c4cf58e30b9f4246d3162
```

Then restart:
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

Done! 🎉
