## 🔄 How It Works

### 1. Loading Courses
```javascript

    const data = await getStudentModules(); // Fetches from backend
    setModules(data || []);
  };
  loadModules();
}, []);
```

### 2. Enrolling in a Course
```javascript
const handleEnroll = async (moduleId) => {
  await enrollInModule(moduleId); // API call to backend
  const data = await getStudentModules(); // Refresh list
  setModules(data || []); // Update UI
};
```

### 3. Filtering Courses
- **Enrolled**: `modules.filter(m => m.isEnrolled)`
